# sshchan-functional
sshchan-functional is a pseudo-implimentation of sshchan (http://neetco.de/chibi/sshchan) written in Haskell.

## Differences between sshchan-functional and sshchan
* Entirely different GUI
* Uses an sqlite database to store boards, posts, bans, etc. (sshchan uses files and directories instead)
* Banning
* Reporting
* Greater speed (probably)

## TODO
* Split up boardview into pages
* Ban appeals
