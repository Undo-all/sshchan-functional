# sshchan-functional
Pseudo-implimentation of sshchan (http://neetco.de/chibi/sshchan) written in Haskell.

## Differences between sshchan-functional and sshchan
* Entirely different GUI
* Uses an sqlite database to store boards, posts, bans, etc. (sshchan uses files and directories instead)
* No formatting 
* Banning
* Greater speed (probably)

## TODO
* Implement simple formatting 
* Split up boardview into pages
* Reporting
